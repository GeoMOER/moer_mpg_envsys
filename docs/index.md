Model dynamic systems, understand drivers and feedbacks, and simulate potential developments.
We live in a complex, dynamic, and man-made environment. Human actions or natural events generally trigger other changes. The latter might occur at remote places or with a considerable delay. This complexity exceeds our cognitive abilities making model building an essential competence not only for Geographers. This course provides room for asking questions to environmental systems and finding answers by modelling their dynamics.

## Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able

    to formulate questions suitable for guiding your modelling
    to model dynamic systems using a graphical notation
    to discuss the scope of application of specific models, simulations and results
    to critically evaluate limitations of educated guesses and potentials of system dynamics
    to reflect modelling as a tool for knowledge generation and decision support

# Course features

The course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program. The provided introductions, explanations and examples might also be useful for self-study.
Syllabus
Systems and models | General introduction, systems and models, hands-on modelling
Deliverables
The course requires to solve problems provided as part of course assignments. The final grade is based on an essay which reflects the own submissions for the course assignments.
Acknowledgements
This course has been inspired by and partly adapted from the Road Maps course from the system dynamics group of J. W. Forrester, Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Forrester 1998). This is especially the case for some working sheet structures and reading suggestions of the introductory sessions. The Road Maps documents are free for educational use.

Most of the models and parametrization are taken from another yet equally excellent book series called System Zoo written by H. Bossel (Bossel 2004a, Bossel 2004b, Bossel 2004c)


# Syllabus

| Session | Topic | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|


The individual sessions can be grouped into three sections:

* First contact: in sessions 1 to 4 we will derive some basic definitions and concepts and start training your modeling competence using different types of graphical modeling tools. Based on that, you will perform first simulations of simple models using a piece of paper and a pencil, a spreadsheet program like Excel or OpenOffice Calc and finally an industrial standard simulation software called Vensim. At the end of this section you should be able to handle some basic terminology and know principal modeling rules. In addition, you should be able to sketch the dynamics of simple models and perform simulations of them by using a modeling software.

* Training: in sessions 5 to 9 we will model three dynamic systems starting with the mother of all dynamics models, the predator-prey model and ending with the often cited tragedy of the commons theme. At the end of this section you should have trained your modeling competence to a point where you feel confident to develop models of similar complexity.

* Application: in sessions 10 to 13 we will slightly change the perspective and focus on simulation not on the modeling itself. As a basis, we will provide more complex models (CO2 dynamics as well as crop farming for the physical geography course and knowledge management as well as globalization and competition for the human geography course) which you will use for sensitivity studies. At the end of this section you should be able to interpret model behavior and simulation results in an applied scientific context.



# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on a team portfolio hosted as a team repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review the paper which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments related to the computation and analysis of the geographic information systems products.
