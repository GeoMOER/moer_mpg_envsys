The natural and man-made environment we live in is complex. This complexity is the result of both countless entities and countless interactions between these entities that together form the environment and its dynamics. As a result, we cannot express or explain the world as a whole. <!--more-->  But even (very small) sub-components of this environment still bear a complexity well beyond our cognitive abilities. One approach to deal with this dilemma is to build descriptive models for well-defined sub-sets of the environment and equally well-defined research questions. In this module we will learn how to descriptively model some aspects of real-world systems and how to perform simulations.
